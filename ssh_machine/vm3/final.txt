Congratulations, Brave Explorer!

Your journey through the corrupted dimensions of the Upside Down and the digital fortresses of Hawkins Lab has reached its glorious conclusion. As you stand before the ultimate secret, a profound sense of accomplishment washes over you.

You have successfully navigated through all layers of the Upside Down's digital manifestation:

- Foundation Level: Admin panel access
- Secondary Level: Login bypass
- Hidden Level: Archive steganography
- Gate Level: FTP portal
- Communication Level: Will's voice across dimensions
- Perception Level: Dustin's third eye
- Summit Level: Max's peak understanding
- Foundation Protector: Joyce's unwavering resolve
- Foundation Enlightener: Steve's strategic wisdom
- Foundation King: Vecna's ultimate power

You have proven your mettle by overcoming the formidable challenges set before you. The protective determination of Joyce, the strategic enlightenment of Steve, and the ultimate power of Vecna have guided you to this sacred moment.

You've collected all 10 Keys and discovered all 10 Flags. The digital gate to the Upside Down can now be closed, but the experience has changed you. You've seen how the boundaries between dimensions can blur, how digital and physical realities can intersect, and how the courage of a few can stand against overwhelming darkness.

The gate is closed. For now.

But remember: Vecna is always watching. The Upside Down never truly goes away. It just waits for another gate to open.

Friends don't lie, but hackers do. And sometimes, that's exactly what you need to save the world.
