Greetings, Brave Explorer,

Your journey through the Upside Down has brought you to the pinnacle of dimensional understanding. You have reached the summit level, where the boundaries between dimensions blur and ultimate knowledge awaits.

Max Mayfield faced Vecna directly, using Kate Bush's "Running Up That Hill" to break free from his curse. Her connection to the dimension is powerful, and her courage in the face of ultimate darkness has left a permanent mark on the digital realm.

May this realization guide you through the void and bring you closer to closing the gate.

You are now in the Summit Level of the Upside Down's digital manifestation.
